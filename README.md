# The way of life

It is an experimental project that wants to calm you down and relax. It does not have any meaning, is to appreciate the little details that make life, Â¡The life!

## Development

Follow the steps to run the project locally:

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Run it locally `npm run start`
3. Check for lint issues with `npm run lint`

Optionally you could use the `Visual Studio Code` and `Remote - Containers` extension, to build the Node environment and run the commands above.
